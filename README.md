# Devops-Learning---Bash-Course-Coderco

this was the first time i truelly learnt how important scripting was and how much it was used, in this module i looked into if statements, variables, parameters and more.

SHEBANG

this is the title of every script you write, it could be said different ways but the most common is 
#!/bin/bash

Comments
also known as "echo" just like in linux we used this to detail what the script was about so anyone could understand it 

Running scripts from anywhere 
this was simple it was to add the script to a folder thats in $PATH.

Variables

this lesson i learnt how i can add data to a script
heres my example:
greeting="ronaldo is the best player in the world"
echo $greeting
